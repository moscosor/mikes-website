        <div><p>The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory, Einstein was born in
             the German Empire but moved to Switzerland in 1895 and renounced his German citizenship in 1896.
             [5] Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the 
             Swiss Federal Polytechnic School (German: eidgenössische polytechnische Schule, later ETH) in 
             Zürich in 1900. The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire 
             life. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent
              examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.</p></div>
